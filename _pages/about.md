I am interested in experimental & computational condensed matter physics and related instrumentation.

You can find some related work that I have done in the research menu. For example, design work of UHV systems, data analysis package for ARPES systems, and several other projects are listed. 

In the blog, I try to write about technical topics that I am interested in; Linux systems, 3d printing, custom electronics, and some practical physics calculations.

Also, you can check my drawing portfolio, mostly storyboards, if you are interested.
