![Model of Double-Gyro](/posts/double_gyroscope_model.gif)

_This post & work is still in progress._ 

Last year, I was given a job to create a toy for general audience for the FU Berlin section of the event 
['Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften'](https://www.langenachtderwissenschaften.de/). The toy needs to show intuitively how ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism works. To put it simply, the spin of electrons needs to align with each other to create magnetism in ferromagnetic materials. 
Antiferromagnetism is also when the spin of electrons is regularly aligned but with a catch; neighboring electrons now have opposite spins, thus creating a net-zero
magnetic field but still ordered magnetism. 

The best way to visualize and play out with the idea of electron spin is a spinning top or a gyroscope. Even though one needs to be careful about how far the analogy
will hold, still with caution, there is no better way to 'feel' the spin other than a mechanical analogy. So with one spinning top, we can have a single electron
let's say. To achieve ferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic behavior, we need at least two electrons or spinning tops. So a toy that doubles the gyroscope can playout
well. If the person rotates both gyroscopes in the same direction, inertia related to angular momentum will be strongly felt; an analogy of ferromagnetism. If they 
are rotated to the opposite direction (even though there is same energy in the system as before) the inertia will be pretty small to be felt; an analogy of 
antiferromagnetism.

So to create this toy, we can already start with the existing ones. Now, the question is, do we want the audience to use a piece of rope or a similar mechanism
to be spin the gyroscope? Obviously no, as it will probably be tough to spin both of the tops at similar speeds. So we need electrical motors, but which kind?
How much torque and power is required to spin the top? 

To calculate this, we need the moment of inertia of our spin-top. The mass of the spin-top is around 106 gr. If we neglect the driving shaft, it is approximately
100gr.

$ I_{zz} = 58301.33 gr (mm^2) \approx 50086.13 gr (mm^2) $ is the moment of inertia for the spin-top. In SI unit, the moment of inertia of a disc is 
$I= \frac{1}{2}MR^2 = \frac{1}{2}(0.1 kg)(0.0317 m)^2 = 50.25 x 10^{-6} kgm^2$

To find out how much force the spin-top needs to align perpendicular to the normal incidence of the surface, we can calculate the angular frequency in which the
precession of the spinning top is minimum. Of course, in the user's hands, calculating minimum precession regarding gravity doesn't make sense. Still, otherwise,
we need to consider different muscle strengths of people, and I am not sure how to do it even. So, as a common standard, we thought defying gravity is already a 
pretty good sign of torque.

where $r= 23.15 + 20 \pm 0.06 mm \approx 0.0432 $. 0.06 is uncertainty related to center of mass, 20 is the skeleton length.

$\omega = \frac{mgr}{I\omega}$ -> formula derived for precession angular velocity as a function of $m, r, I $ and $g = 9.806 m/s^2$

and we measured how much time it takes for one precession revolution for an arbitrary angle to see how much $\omega$ is required to defy gravity.
